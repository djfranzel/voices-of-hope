    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>To provide accessible music-making opportunities within justice-involved populations that foster individual
      growth and bridge unlikely communities through song.</p>

    <h2>Hopes</h2>
    <p>We recognize that Voices of Hope has a dual calling to serve communities both inside and outside of Minnesotaâ€™s
      state prisons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>BRINGING HOPE INSIDE PRISON WALLS Voices of Hope provides a safe and sober activity which empowers
        incarcerated individuals to find their voice, build connections in a diverse setting, and bring a positive
        message of hope and healing to the wider correctional facility.
      </li>
      <li>BRINGING HOPE OUTSIDE PRISON WALLS Voices of Hope views singing as a powerful tool of restorative justice,
        seeking to transform perspectives of incarceration and build bridges of healing within the wider community
        through collaboration and reflection.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Voices of Hope is an organization that builds choral singing communities in correctional facilities in the state
      of Minnesota. The flagship ensemble, Voices of Hope-Shakopee, was founded in 2015 by Dr. Amanda Weber and has
      grown from 15 to 50 incarcerated singers. The organization has recently expanded to include Voices of
      Hope-Stillwater. Both choirs rehearse weekly and perform several times a year inside their respective
      facilities.</p>
