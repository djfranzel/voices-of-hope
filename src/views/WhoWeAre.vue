        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>To provide accessible music-making opportunities within justice-involved populations that foster individual
          growth and bridge unlikely communities through song.</p>
        <h2>Hopes</h2>
        <p>We recognize that Voices of Hope has a dual calling to serve communities both inside and outside of Minnesotaâ€™s
          state prisons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>BRINGING HOPE INSIDE PRISON WALLS Voices of Hope provides a safe and sober activity which empowers
            incarcerated individuals to find their voice, build connections in a diverse setting, and bring a positive
            message of hope and healing to the wider correctional facility.
          </li>
          <li>BRINGING HOPE OUTSIDE PRISON WALLS Voices of Hope views singing as a powerful tool of restorative justice,
            seeking to transform perspectives of incarceration and build bridges of healing within the wider community
            through collaboration and reflection.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Voices of Hope is an organization that builds choral singing communities in correctional facilities in the state
          of Minnesota. The flagship ensemble, Voices of Hope-Shakopee, was founded in 2015 by Dr. Amanda Weber and has
          grown from 15 to 50 incarcerated singers. The organization has recently expanded to include Voices of
          Hope-Stillwater. Both choirs rehearse weekly and perform several times a year inside their respective
          facilities.</p>
        <p>Here is a recording of the <b>Voices of Hope</b> singing <i>"Inscription of Hope"</i> by <i>Z. Randall
          Stroope</i>, recorded as a part of our 2017 Summer Jam.</p>
