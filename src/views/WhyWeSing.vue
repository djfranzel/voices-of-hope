        <h2 class="mb-3">BENEFITS OF CHORAL SINGING</h2>
        <p>No matter who you are or what kind of singing you do, the benefits to your physical, and mental/emotional
          health are vast! Proven benefits of choral singing include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>improved lung function</li>
          <li>increases heart rate variability</li>
          <li>aids the circulatory system</li>
          <li>releases oxytocin which has been found to increase trust, reduce negative behavior, and potentially
            increase social bonding
          </li>
          <li>increases levels of secretory immunoglobulin A, a hormone which protects the body from bacterial and viral
            infection, boosting the immune system and leading to increased positivity and relaxation
          </li>
          <li>triggers endorphin release, resulting in both euphoric and sedative states</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Studies of prison choirs are limited due to the research protections of incarcerated people as a “vulnerable
          population.” Data-based research studies include:</p>
        <p>
          Cohen, Mary L. “Choral Singing and Prison Inmates: Influences of Singing in a Prison
          Choir.” Journal of Correctional Education 60, no. 1 (2009): 52-65.<br>
          Cohen, Mary L. "Explorations of Inmate and Volunteer Choral Experiences in a
          Prison-based Choir." Australian Journal of Music Education, no. 1 (2007): 61-72.<br>

        </p>
        <p>These studies suggest that the social experience of singing in choir is what has been most impactful for
          singers. Other research-based benefits include:</p>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>improved life skills, such as goal-oriented behavior, self-discipline, and improved communication</li>
          <li>more positive self-esteem</li>
          <li>perceived benefits as joy, increased feelings of self-worth and self-confidence</li>
          <li>purpose, a sense of belonging, spiritual connection, and pride</li>
          <li>collaboration with “outside” community singers shows potential for positive transformative change for both
            participant groups
          </li>
          <li>the social experience of choir increased racial tolerance and understanding, opened people’s minds, and
            led to an increased desire to help others
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Voices of Hope contributed to this research through Dr. Amanda Weber’s 2018 dissertation. The survey and
          interview data collected through Weber’s program evaluation showed the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>VOH singers described increased feelings of happiness, positivity, self-worth, accomplishment, and an
            improved attitude
          </li>
          <li>Multiple singers believe their aggression has decreased; some singers feel they cry more often and have
            become more open with their feelings
          </li>
          <li>Many singers said they feel more open to trying new things and believe that choir has helped them to come
            out of their shell
          </li>
          <li>Several participants said they want to use their voices for good in the community</li>
          <li>The most commonly cited theme was connection; for many singers, choir has enabled a sense of bonding and
            increased empathy in a diverse setting
          </li>

        <h3 class="font-italic mb-1">Reflections from incarcerated singers</h3>
        <p>“I had forgotten how important music was to me, but Voices of Hope reminded me how much my spirit needs music, my soul needs to heal.”</p>
        <p>“I came into this experience and didn’t speak to anyone. I was of this mindset of I don’t see any potential for anything good… Now I’m in this community and there’s something I’m looking forward to doing here. And it doesn’t make me feel anxious or terrified or angry. The choir really allowed me to acknowledge that I could feel happiness while I was incarcerated. And connectivity. I feel less prone to negative emotional upheaval.”</p>
        <p>"[Collaborating with outside singers] has forever impacted my life.  To have people who know nothing about us but who want to be a part of supporting us!  It has given me the ability myself to look past my label as a felon or prisoner."</p>
        <p class="mb-7">“[Through choir,] I was reunited with the girl I had lost somewhere along the broken road that brought me here.  The girl who sings in the shower, the one who lets music crawl into her heart sending shivers up and down her spine, the girl who allows music and voice to fill the vast emptiness inside of her with hope… What a blessing it is to be reunited to that forgotten part of myself.”</p>
        <v-img src="../static/cantus_40.jpg" style="float: left" max-width="100%" width="450px"
               class="mr-7 mb-7 elevation-5"></v-img>
        <h3 class="font-italic mb-1">Reflections from outside collaborators</h3>
        <p>“My experiences singing with the Voices of Hope have had an immeasurable impact on my perspective of the world and our nation’s system of incarceration…I got to know several of the women beyond their names and interests and found their desire for redemption and a fresh start both heartbreaking and inspiring.”</p>
        <p>"I had many emotional conversations with people on the outside trying to describe my experience [collaborating with the Voices of Hope], and my empathetic response. How my heart broke for the women and how their paths had led them there, and how in some corner of myself I wished I could switch places with one of them. I could feel their sadness and the joy in their singing… It is difficult to talk about the complexity of the experience. How pain and joy live in the same room in such an open way."</p>
